## A Notepad App with To Do lists   

I want to create a notepad app with a to-do list, reminders, and event scheduling. It should say hello world, tell me the date, and then list all of my tasks and notes.

I want it to record dates from my to-do list, schedule when it needs to be completed by, and provide reminders when the deadline is approaching. 

It should be a web app with user accounts, built in typescript with next.js and shadcn components.
