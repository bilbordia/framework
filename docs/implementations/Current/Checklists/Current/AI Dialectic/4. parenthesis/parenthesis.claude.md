# AI Dialectic Engine Implementation Plan

## Preamble

This document outlines the detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for the AI Dialectic Engine project, based on the synthesized requirements from the provided PRDs. The implementation follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with continuous integration principles, ensuring the application remains in a working, buildable, and deployable state at every step.

**Primary Goal:** Implement a multi-model AI collaboration system starting with the Thesis/Hypothesis stage, where users can submit a single prompt to multiple AI models simultaneously and export the results to GitHub as organized markdown files.

**Architecture Approach:** Build upon the existing monorepo structure (`Backend (Supabase Functions) ‚Üî API Client (@paynless/api) ‚Üî State (@paynless/store) ‚Üî Frontend (apps/web)`) and extend the current chat system to support multi-model collaboration.

**Implementation Philosophy:** Each step maintains application stability, includes comprehensive testing, and enables continuous deployment through our CI/CD pipeline.
