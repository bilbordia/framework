# Frontend Performance Optimization: Bundle Size Reduction

## Preamble

This document outlines the detailed, step-by-step implementation plan to significantly improve the web application's Lighthouse performance score by reducing the initial JavaScript bundle size. The current bundle size is unacceptably large, leading to slow page load times and a poor user experience.

This plan will focus on two primary strategies:
1.  **Code Splitting:** Implementing route-based lazy loading to ensure users only download the code they need for the view they are currently interacting with.
2.  **Server-Side Logic Migration:** Identifying and moving large, computationally expensive libraries that are not essential for initial render from the client-side bundle to a backend service.

The implementation will strictly follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach where applicable and adhere to the existing monorepo architecture.

**Goal:** To guide a developer through the implementation process, ensuring the application's bundle size is drastically reduced, leading to a measurable improvement in Lighthouse scores and a faster, more responsive user experience.

## Project Success Metrics

*   **Lighthouse Performance Score:** Increase the mobile performance score to > 80.
*   **Initial JS Bundle Size:** Reduce the main `index.js` chunk to less than 1MB (gzipped).
*   **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** Decrease TBT to be within the "Good" range (< 200ms).
*   **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Decrease FCP to be within the "Good" range (< 1.8s).

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

*   **Risk: Breaking Changes from Asynchronous Refactoring:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Hooks and components that are refactored from synchronous to asynchronous will have their return types and consumption patterns changed. A systematic, global search for all usages of the refactored component will be performed to ensure every instance is updated correctly. Unit and integration tests are critical.
*   **Risk: Increased Perceived Latency:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Moving logic to the server introduces network latency. The UI must be updated to provide immediate feedback (e.g., loading spinners, disabled buttons) to the user while the server-side calculation is in progress.
*   **Risk: Incomplete Test Coverage:**
    *   **Mitigation:** The plan explicitly includes steps to write or update unit and integration tests for every change, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. No feature will be considered complete until its tests are passing.

## Section 1: Route-Based Code Splitting

**Goal:** Ensure that the code for each page (route) is only loaded when the user navigates to it. This is the first line of defense against large bundles.

---
*   `[‚úÖ] 1.1 [UI/REFACTOR]` **Lazy Load Page Components**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.1.1` In `apps/web/src/routes/routes.tsx`, import `lazy` from `react`.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.1.2` Convert all static page component imports (e.g., `import { LoginPage } from ...`) to use the `lazy()` function (e.g., `const LoginPage = lazy(...)`).
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.1.3` Ensure the conversion correctly handles both named and default exports.
*   `[‚úÖ] 1.2 [UI/REFACTOR]` **Implement Suspense Fallback**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.2.1` In the root layout component (`apps/web/src/components/routes/RootRoute.tsx`), import `Suspense` from `react`.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.2.2` Wrap the `<Outlet />` component with `<Suspense fallback={...}>` to provide a loading UI while page chunks are being fetched.
*   `[‚úÖ] 1.3 [CONFIG]` **Analyze Bundle Composition**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.3.1` Install `rollup-plugin-visualizer` as a dev dependency in the `apps/web` workspace.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.3.2` Update `apps/web/vite.config.ts` to include the visualizer plugin.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 1.3.3` Run a production build and analyze the output to confirm `js-tiktoken` is the main issue.
*   `[‚úÖ] 1.4 [COMMIT]` feat(web): implement route-based code splitting

## Section 2: Migrate Token Calculation to Server-Side

**Goal:** For the best performance and smallest bundle, move the token counting logic entirely to the backend, removing the `js-tiktoken` dependency from the frontend bundle altogether.

---
*   `[‚úÖ] 2.1 [BE]` **Create Server-Side Endpoint for Token Estimation**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.1.1` Create a new Supabase Edge Function: `tokenEstimator`.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.1.2` Add an action `estimateTokens` to this service.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` The action will accept a payload: `{ textOrMessages: string | MessageForTokenCounting[], modelConfig: AiModelExtendedConfig }`.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` The implementation will be the logic currently in `packages/utils/src/tokenCostUtils.ts`. This function will now import `js-tiktoken` on the server, not the client.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.1.3 [TEST-INT]` Write integration tests for the `estimateTokens` action.
*   `[‚úÖ] 2.2 [API]` **Update API Client**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.2.1` Add a new method `estimateTokens(payload)` to the `@paynless/api` client that invokes the new `tokenEstimator` Edge Function.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.2.2 [TEST-UNIT]` Write unit tests for the new API client method.
*   `[‚úÖ] 2.3 [UI/REFACTOR]` **Refactor `useTokenEstimator` to use the API**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.3.1` Modify `apps/web/src/hooks/useTokenEstimator.ts`.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` The hook must become asynchronous, changing its signature to return an object: `{ estimatedTokens: number; isLoading: boolean; }`.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` The implementation should use `useState` and `useEffect`. The `useEffect` will call the new API client method from `2.2.1`.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` It must manage a loading state while waiting for the server's response.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.3.2 [TEST-UNIT]` Update tests in `apps/web/src/hooks/useTokenEstimator.test.ts`.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` Mock the API client call.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` Update tests to assert the new return shape `{ estimatedTokens, isLoading }`.
        *   `[‚úÖ]` Use `waitFor` or other async testing utilities to test the hook's behavior.
*   `[‚úÖ] 2.4 [UI/REFACTOR]` **Update Components Consuming `useTokenEstimator`**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.4.1` Systematically find all components that use `useTokenEstimator` (e.g., `CurrentMessageTokenEstimator`, `ChatInput`, `ChatAffordabilityIndicator`) and update them to handle the new asynchronous return type. This involves destructuring `{ estimatedTokens, isLoading }` and handling the loading state appropriately.
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.4.2 [TEST-UNIT]` Update all relevant component unit tests to mock the new asynchronous hook behavior and test the loading states.
*   `[‚è∏Ô∏è] 2.5 [REFACTOR]` **Initial Cleanup and Discovery**
    *   `[‚úÖ] 2.5.1` Delete the `packages/utils/src/tokenCostUtils.ts` file as it's no longer needed on the client.
    *   **Discovery:** Deleting `tokenCostUtils.ts` revealed a critical flaw in the original plan. The file also contained `getMaxOutputTokens`, which performed a vital affordability check on the client-side before sending a message. This logic was not part of the `tokenEstimator` migration and was lost, breaking the application's cost-control mechanism. The server must be the single source of truth for this check.
*   `[‚úÖ] 2.6 [COMMIT]` feat(perf): move token estimation to server and refactor consumers

---

## Section 3: Implement Server-Side Affordability Enforcement

**Goal:** Correct the flaw discovered in Section 2 by migrating the critical `getMaxOutputTokens` logic to the server, ensuring all affordability and cost-control checks are performed on the backend before any request is sent to an AI provider.

---
*   `[‚úÖ] 3.1 [BE]` **Create Server-Side Affordability Utility**
    *   `[‚úÖ]` A new file was created at `supabase/functions/_shared/utils/affordability_utils.ts`.
    *   `[‚úÖ]` This file now contains the `getMaxOutputTokens` function, ported directly from the original client-side `tokenCostUtils.ts`.
*   `[‚úÖ] 3.2 [BE/REFACTOR]` **Update `chat` Edge Function to Enforce Limits**
    *   `[‚úÖ]` The main `chat` function (`supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`) now imports and uses `getMaxOutputTokens`.
    *   `[‚úÖ]` **For every chat request (both normal and rewind paths):**
        1.  The server estimates the input token cost.
        2.  It calls `getMaxOutputTokens` to calculate the absolute maximum number of output tokens the user's wallet can afford.
        3.  If the user cannot afford any output (`maxAllowedOutputTokens <= 0`), the request is rejected with a `402 Payment Required` error.
        4.  The server now uses this calculated `maxAllowedOutputTokens` as the upper bound for the `max_tokens_to_generate` parameter sent to the AI provider, ensuring the user cannot overspend.
*   `[‚úÖ] 3.3 [COMMIT]` fix(server): implement and enforce server-side affordability checks

---

## Section 4: Final Cleanup and Verification

**Goal:** With all token estimation and affordability logic now securely on the server, remove the final pieces of redundant client-side code and verify the successful reduction of the frontend bundle.

---
*   `[‚úÖ] 4.1 [STORE/REFACTOR]` **Remove Redundant Client-Side Logic**
    *   `[‚úÖ]` The client-side affordability check that was causing test failures is now fully handled by the server.
    *   `[‚úÖ]` In `packages/store/src/ai.SendMessage.ts`, remove any remaining client-side logic and imports related to `getMaxOutputTokens` or `estimateInputTokens`. The `coreMessageProcessing` function should now be much simpler, primarily focused on constructing the `ChatApiRequest` and calling the API.
*   `[‚úÖ] 4.2 [TEST-UNIT/TEST-INT]` **Run Full Test Suite**
    *   `[‚úÖ]` After the cleanup in `4.1`, run the full test suite (`pnpm test`) to ensure no regressions were introduced and that all client-side tests pass.
*   `[‚úÖ] 4.3 [CONFIG]` **Verify Final Bundle Size**
    *   `[‚úÖ]` Run a production build (`pnpm --filter=web build`).
    *   `[‚úÖ]` Analyze the bundle visualizer output (`apps/web/dist/stats.html`) to confirm that `js-tiktoken` is no longer included in the client-side bundle.
*   `[‚úÖ] 4.4 [COMMIT]` feat(perf): complete token logic migration and verify bundle reduction
