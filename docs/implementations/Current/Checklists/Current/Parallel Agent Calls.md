# AI Dialectic - Parallel Agent Calls Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to refactor the AI Dialectic contribution generation process from a serial, synchronous workflow to a parallel, asynchronous one. This change is critical to reduce user-facing latency, improve system throughput, and enhance reliability by decoupling long-running backend tasks from the client-side request-response cycle. This plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

## Legend

*   `[ ]` 1. Unstarted work step. Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference. We begin with 1.
    *   `[ ]` 1.a. Work steps will be nested as shown. Substeps use characters, as is typical with legal documents.
        *   `[ ]` 1. a. i. Nesting can be as deep as logically required, using roman numerals, according to standard legal document numbering processes.
*   `[‚úÖ]` Represents a completed step or nested set.
*   `[üöß]` Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set.
*   `[‚è∏Ô∏è]` Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking or further clarification.
*   `[‚ùì]` Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing.
*   `[üö´]` Represents a blocked, halted, or stopped step or nested set that has an unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing.

## Phase 1: Backend Refactoring for Asynchronous Parallel Execution (TDD)

### 1. Backend Core Logic Refactoring
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 1.a. [TEST-UNIT] Write a new failing unit test in `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/generateContribution.test.ts` to assert that the function returns an immediate success response and processes the AI calls in a detached, asynchronous block.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 1.b. [REFACTOR] Refactor the `generateContributions` function in `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/generateContribution.ts` to use `Promise.allSettled`. Move the core logic into an `async` IIFE so the main function returns immediately.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 1.c. [TEST-UNIT] Refactor the existing synchronous tests in the file to accommodate the new async-wrapper pattern, or remove/stub them if they are no longer relevant.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 1.d. [TEST-UNIT] Make the new asynchronous test from `1.a` pass.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 1.e. [COMMIT] `feat(backend): Implement parallel contribution generation`

### 2. Backend Notification Integration
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 2.a. [REFACTOR] Review existing backend functions that create notifications. Discover the existing `create_notification_for_user` database function.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 2.b. [TEST-UNIT] Write a new failing unit test in `generateContribution.test.ts` to assert that the `dbClient.rpc('create_notification_for_user', ...)` method is called with the correct parameters upon successful completion of the async block.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 2.c. [BE] Modify the async block in `generateContributions` to call the `create_notification_for_user` RPC function with the `projectOwnerUserId` and a payload containing the final status and results.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 2.d. [TEST-UNIT] Make the new RPC test from `2.b` pass.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 2.e. [COMMIT] `feat(backend): Add completion notification for contribution generation`

## Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring for Asynchronous UI Updates (TDD)

### 3. Store and State Management
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.a. [TEST-UNIT] In `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.test.ts`, write a failing test for the `generateContributions` thunk.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.a.i. The test should assert that after the action is called, the store's state is immediately updated to reflect a "generating" status for the specific session (e.g., `generatingSessions[sessionId] = true`).
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.b. [STORE] In `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.ts`, add the new state `generatingSessions: { [sessionId: string]: boolean }` to `DialecticStateValues`.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.c. [STORE] Modify the `generateContributions` thunk. It should call the API but *not* wait for the full process. Upon receiving the immediate success response, it should update `generatingSessions` in the state. Make the test from `3.a` pass.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.d. [TEST-UNIT] In `packages/store/src/notificationStore.test.ts`, write a test to verify how the store handles the new `'contribution_generation_complete'` notification type.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.d.i. Simulate a Realtime event for the new notification type.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.d.ii. Assert that a new internal handler in the `dialecticStore` is called as a result. This proves the two stores can interoperate.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.e. [STORE] In `packages/store/src/notificationStore.ts`, modify `handleIncomingNotification` to check for `notification.type === 'contribution_generation_complete'`.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.e.i. When this notification type is received, it should call an internal handler in the `dialecticStore`, e.g., `_handleGenerationCompleteEvent(notification.data)`.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.f. [STORE] In `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.ts`, implement the new internal event handler `_handleGenerationCompleteEvent({ sessionId })`.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.f.i. **Note:** This is not a new user-facing thunk, but a required internal function to process the asynchronous completion event from the `notificationStore`. This ensures the existing `generateContributions` thunk is refactored in place.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.f.ii. This handler will set `generatingSessions[sessionId] = false`.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.f.iii. It will then trigger the existing `fetchDialecticProjectDetails` action to refresh the UI with the newly created contributions.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 3.g. [COMMIT] `feat(store): Update dialectic store for async contribution generation`

### 4. UI Component Updates
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 4.a. [TEST-COMPONENT] In `GenerateContributionButton.test.tsx`, write a failing test that mocks `useDialecticStore` to simulate a "generating" state for the current session and asserts that the button correctly disables itself and displays a "Generating..." message.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 4.b. [COMPONENT] Refactor `GenerateContributionButton.tsx` to use the new `generatingSessions[sessionId]` state from the `dialecticStore` to control its disabled state and text.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 4.c. [COMPONENT] Remove the now-obsolete `onGenerationStart` and `onGenerationComplete` props from `GenerateContributionButton` and any parent components.

### 5. Parent Component Cleanup
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 5.a. [COMPONENT] In `DialecticSessionView.tsx` (or the parent of `GenerateContributionButton`), remove the state management for `isGenerating` and the handler functions (`handleGenerationStart`, `handleGenerationComplete`).

---

## Phase 3: Final Integration and Documentation

### 6. Integration Testing
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.a. [TEST-INT] Write an integration test that covers the flow from the `dialecticStore`'s `generateContributions` action to the backend `generateContributions` function.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.a.i. This test will verify that the API client correctly calls the backend and that the initial state change in the store is correct.
   *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.b. [TEST-E2E] Manually test or update/create an E2E test for the entire workflow:
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.b.i. Click the "Generate" button.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.b.ii. Assert that the button enters a loading state.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.b.iii. Assert that an initial "Generation started" toast appears.
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.b.iv. Wait for and assert that a "Generation complete" notification appears (via the standard notification bell/popup).
       *   `[‚úÖ]` 6.b.v. Assert that the UI refreshes to show the new contributions.

### 7. Documentation
   *   `[ ]` 7.a. [DOCS] Update the architecture documentation and any relevant READMEs to reflect the new asynchronous, parallel, TDD-driven flow.

---

## Phase 4: UI/UX Refactoring and Process Improvements (TDD)

### 8. Core UI Structure and Workflow Refactoring
   *   `[ ]` 8.a. [TEST-UNIT] Write a failing test for `DialecticSessionDetailsPage.tsx` to assert that it directly renders the `GenerateContributionButton` and `AIModelSelector` components in a persistent location, outside of the stage navigation area.
   *   `[ ]` 8.b. [REFACTOR] In `StageTabCard.tsx`, remove the `GenerateContributionButton` and `AIModelSelector` components.
   *   `[ ]` 8.c. [UI] In `DialecticSessionDetailsPage.tsx`, render `GenerateContributionButton` and `AIModelSelector` directly in a new fixed location (e.g., below the session info card). Pass the required props to them. This makes the test from `8.a` pass.
   *   `[ ]` 8.d. [TEST-UNIT] Write a failing test for the generation button logic on `DialecticSessionDetailsPage.tsx`. The test should verify the button is enabled when the active session's status is `'<stage>_generation_failed'`.
   *   `[ ]` 8.e. [REFACTOR] Implement the logic on `DialecticSessionDetailsPage.tsx` to enable the `GenerateContributionButton` when the session status is appropriate for generation or re-generation (e.g., `pending_<stage_slug>` or `${stage.slug}_generation_failed`). This makes the test from `8.d` pass.
   *   `[ ]` 8.f. [COMMIT] `refactor(ui): Centralize session controls on details page`

### 9. Stage Navigation Redesign
   *   `[ ]` 9.a. [TEST-UNIT] Write a failing test for `StageTabCard.tsx` that asserts it renders a single, compact, chevron-styled element instead of a large card.
   *   `[ ]` 9.b. [REFACTOR] In `StageTabCard.tsx`, completely overhaul the render method.
       *   `[ ]` 9.b.i. Remove the `Card` component and all its parts.
       *   `[ ]` 9.b.ii. The root element should now be a `Button` or `Link`-like component with a `variant` that makes it look like a breadcrumb or step in a process.
       *   `[ ]` 9.b.iii. The component will display the stage `display_name` and be visually connected to its siblings on the page with a chevron icon (`>`) rendered in the parent component's loop.
   *   `[ ]` 9.c. [UI] In `DialecticSessionDetailsPage.tsx`, adjust the mapping logic for the `StageTabCard` components to render them in a horizontal flex container, placing a chevron icon between each one.
   *   `[ ]` 9.d. [COMMIT] `refactor(ui): Transform stage tabs into a compact step navigator`

### 10. Session Info and Contribution Display Enhancements
   *   `[ ]` 10.a. [TEST-UNIT] Write a failing test for `SessionInfoCard.tsx` asserting that its content is wrapped in an `Accordion` component from ShadCN/UI.
   *   `[ ]` 10.b. [UI] In `SessionInfoCard.tsx`, wrap the `CardContent` in an `<Accordion type="single" collapsible>` component. The `CardHeader` can serve as the `AccordionTrigger`. Make the test from `10.a` pass.
   *   `[ ]` 10.c. [UI] Review all components on `DialecticSessionDetailsPage.tsx` to ensure they gracefully handle the asynchronous loading states (`generatingSessions`) from the `dialecticStore`. The UI should clearly indicate when a specific session's contributions are being generated.
   *   `[ ]` 10.d. [COMMIT] `feat(ui): Make SessionInfoCard collapsible and improve async state display`

### 11. Workflow and Error Handling Improvements
    *   `[ ]` 11.a. [TEST-UNIT] Write a failing test for `ControlPanel.tsx` that verifies the `GenerateContributionButton` is enabled when the session status is `'<stage>_generation_failed'`.
    *   `[ ]` 11.b. [REFACTOR] In `ControlPanel.tsx` (or directly in the `GenerateContributionButton` if the logic remains there), update the `disabled` logic. The button should be enabled if the session status is `pending_<stage_slug>` OR `${stage.slug}_generation_failed`. This makes the test from `11.a` pass.
    *   `[ ]` 11.c. [REFACTOR] Review the "Regenerate" logic. The button text should display "Regenerate" if contributions for the current stage and iteration *already exist*, regardless of the session status. This allows users to regenerate successful contributions if they are unsatisfied.
    *   `[‚úÖ]` 11.d. [COMMIT] `fix(workflow): Allow contribution generation from failed state and improve regeneration flow`

[DEPLOY] Consider deployment after all phases are complete and thoroughly tested.
