# AI Chat Enhancements: PARENTHESIS Implementation Plan

## Preamble

This document outlines the detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for the AI Chat Enhancements project, based on the synthesized requirements (SYNTHESIS #1, #2, #3) and user feedback. It follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach (Red -> Green -> Refactor) and adheres to the existing monorepo architecture (`Backend (Supabase Functions) <-> API Client (@paynless/api) <-> State (@paynless/store) <-> Frontend (apps/web)`).

**Goal:** To guide the development team through the implementation process, ensuring all requirements are met, code quality is maintained, and features are delivered reliably.

## Legend

*   [ ] Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference 
    *   [ ] Worksteps will be nested as shown
        *   [ ] Nesting can be as deep as logically required 
*   [‚úÖ] Represents a completed step or nested set
*   [üöß] Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set
*   [‚è∏Ô∏è] Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking 
*   [‚ùì] Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing 
*   [üö´] Represents a blocked, halted, stopped step or nested set that has some unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing

## Component Types and Labels

The implementation plan uses the following labels to categorize work steps:

* **[DB]:** Database Schema Change (Migration)
* **[RLS]:** Row-Level Security Policy
* **[BE]:** Backend Logic (Edge Function / RLS / Helpers)
* **[API]:** API Client Library (`@paynless/api`)
* **[STORE]:** State Management (`@paynless/store`)
* **[UI]:** Frontend Component (`apps/web`)
* **[TEST-UNIT]:** Unit Test Implementation/Update
* **[TEST-INT]:** Integration Test Implementation/Update (API, Store-Component, RLS)
* **[ANALYTICS]:** Analytics Integration (`@paynless/analytics`)
* **[REFACTOR]:** Code Refactoring Step
* **[COMMIT]:** Checkpoint for Git Commit

**Core Principles:**

*   **TDD:** Write failing tests before implementation code (RED), write code to make tests pass (GREEN), then refactor (REFACTOR).
*   **Modularity:** Build reusable components, functions, and modules.
*   **Architecture:** Respect the existing API <-> Store <-> UI flow and the `api` Singleton pattern.
*   **Explicitness:** Leave nothing to assumption. Detail every sub-step.
*   **Testing:** Unit tests (`[TEST-UNIT]`) for isolated logic, Integration tests (`[TEST-INT]`) for interactions (API-Store, Store-UI, Backend Endpoints). E2E tests (`[TEST-E2E]`) are optional/manual for this phase.
*   **Analytics:** Integrate `packages/analytics` for all relevant user interactions (`[ANALYTICS]`)
*   **Commits:** Commit frequently after Green/Refactor stages with clear messages (`[COMMIT]`)
*   **Checkpoints:** Stop, run tests (`npm test`), build (`npm run build`), restart dev server after significant steps/phases.

**Reference Requirements:** Use REQ-XXX codes from SYNTHESIS #2 PRD for traceability.

# Phase 4.6: Multi-User Organization Chat Implementation

**Goal:** To enable organization members to create, participate in, and manage multi-user chat sessions within their organization, including the ability for direct user-to-user messaging within a chat.

**Branch:** `feature/multi-user-chat`

---

## Phase 4.6.A: Backend Foundation for Multi-User Chats

**Goal:** Establish the necessary database schema and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to support multi-user chat functionalities, including participants, roles, and message types.

### STEP-4.6.A.1: Database Schema Enhancements [DB] [COMMIT]

*   **[DB]** Create `chat_participants` table:
    *   `id`: `uuid`, primary key, default `uuid_generate_v4()`
    *   `chat_id`: `uuid`, foreign key to `chats.id` (on delete cascade)
    *   `user_id`: `uuid`, foreign key to `auth.users.id` (on delete cascade)
    *   `role`: `text` (e.g., 'creator', 'member', 'admin_added'), not null
    *   `joined_at`: `timestamptz`, default `now()`
    *   `invited_by_user_id`: `uuid`, foreign key to `auth.users.id` (nullable, for tracking who invited whom)
    *   `created_at`: `timestamptz`, default `now()`
    *   `updated_at`: `timestamptz`, default `now()`
    *   **Indexes:** `(chat_id)`, `(user_id)`, `(chat_id, user_id)` (unique constraint)
    *   **[DB]** Write SQL migration script for `chat_participants`.
*   **[DB]** Modify `chats` table:
    *   Add `is_multi_user`: `boolean`, default `false`, not null. (Alternatively, derive this from `chat_participants` count > 1 if performance allows, but explicit flag might be simpler for queries).
    *   Add `last_activity_at`: `timestamptz`, default `now()`. (To be updated when new messages are added, useful for sorting).
    *   Clarify `user_id` column: Rename to `creator_user_id` if it signifies the original creator, or make nullable if chats can be purely organizational without a single "owner". For now, assume it's `creator_user_id`.
    *   **[DB]** Write SQL migration script for `chats` table modifications.
*   **[DB]** Modify `chat_messages` table:
    *   Add `recipient_user_id`: `uuid`, foreign key to `auth.users.id` (nullable). Used for direct user-to-user messages.
    *   Add `is_direct_message`: `boolean`, default `false`, not null. If true, this message is only for `recipient_user_id` and not processed by AI.
    *   Ensure `user_id` on `chat_messages` accurately reflects the sender.
    *   **[DB]** Write SQL migration script for `chat_messages` table modifications.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit migration scripts with message "feat(DB): Add schema for multi-user chats (participants, chat/message updates)".

### STEP-4.6.A.2: Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies [RLS] [COMMIT]

*   **[RLS]** For `chats` table:
    *   **SELECT:**
        *   Users can select their own private (non-org, `organization_id IS NULL`, `creator_user_id = auth.uid()`).
        *   Organization members (`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM organization_members om WHERE om.organization_id = chats.organization_id AND om.user_id = auth.uid())`) can select chats belonging to their organization (`chats.organization_id IS NOT NULL`).
    *   **INSERT:**
        *   Users can insert private chats (`organization_id IS NULL`, `creator_user_id = auth.uid()`).
        *   Organization members can insert chats for their organization if `allow_member_chat_creation` is true OR if they are org admins.
    *   **UPDATE:**
        *   Creators can update their own private chats.
        *   For org chats: Chat creator OR Org admins can update (e.g., title). (Potentially allow any participant to update title if desired).
    *   **DELETE:**
        *   Creators can delete their own private chats.
        *   For org chats: Chat creator OR Org admins can delete.
*   **[RLS]** For `chat_participants` table:
    *   **SELECT:**
        *   Users can select their own participation records (`user_id = auth.uid()`).
        *   Users can select participation records for chats they are a participant in.
        *   Org admins can select participation records for chats within their organization.
    *   **INSERT:**
        *   Users can be added as participants if:
            *   They are the chat creator adding themselves.
            *   They are invited by an existing participant of an org chat (if allowed by chat settings - future enhancement).
            *   They are an org member joining a public org chat.
            *   Org admins can add members to org chats.
    *   **UPDATE:** (Roles, etc.) - Generally restrictive. Chat creator or org admin.
    *   **DELETE:** (Removing participants)
        *   Users can remove themselves.
        *   Chat creator or org admin can remove others.
*   **[RLS]** For `chat_messages` table:
    *   **SELECT:**
        *   Users can select messages in chats they are a participant in (`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM chat_participants cp WHERE cp.chat_id = chat_messages.chat_id AND cp.user_id = auth.uid())`).
        *   For direct messages (`is_direct_message = true`), only the sender (`user_id = auth.uid()`) or recipient (`recipient_user_id = auth.uid()`) can select, AND they must be a participant in the parent chat.
    *   **INSERT:**
        *   Users can insert messages into chats they are a participant in.
        *   Message `user_id` must be `auth.uid()`.
        *   If `is_direct_message = true`, `recipient_user_id` must be a participant in the same chat.
    *   **UPDATE:** Users can update their own messages (if editing is allowed).
    *   **DELETE:** Users can delete their own messages (if allowed). Org admins or chat creators might have broader delete permissions.
*   **[TEST-UNIT]** Write RLS tests using a framework like `pgTAP` or simulate via Supabase JS client tests with different user roles.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit RLS policies and tests with message "feat(RLS): Implement RLS for multi-user chat tables".

---

## Phase 4.6.B: Core Backend Logic

**Goal:** Implement backend services and Edge Functions to manage multi-user chat lifecycle: creation, invitations, joining, messaging (both AI-assisted and direct user-to-user), and retrieving chat/participant data.

### STEP-4.6.B.1: User Profile Access [BE] [API] [STORE] [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]

*   **[BE]** Create/Update Edge Function `get-user-profiles-by-ids`:
    *   Accepts a list of `user_ids`.
    *   Fetches public profile information (id, full_name, avatar_url, username - ensure these are safe to share within an org context) for the given user IDs.
    *   RLS on `profiles` table should allow org members to see basic profiles of other members in the same org.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test function for fetching profiles, handling errors, and RLS.
*   **[API]** Add `getUserProfilesByIds(userIds: string[]): Promise<ApiResponse<UserProfile[]>>` to `user.api.ts`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test API client method.
*   **[STORE]** In `userStore.ts` (or a shared store):
    *   Add state: `profilesCache: { [userId: string]: UserProfile }`.
    *   Add action: `fetchUserProfiles(userIds: string[]): Promise<UserProfile[]>`:
        *   Checks cache first. Fetches missing profiles via API client. Updates cache.
        *   Returns the requested profiles.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test store action for caching and API calls.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with message "feat(User): Implement backend and store for fetching user profiles by IDs".

### STEP-4.6.B.2: Chat Creation and Invitation Logic [BE] [API] [STORE] [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]

*   **[BE]** Create Edge Function `create-multi-user-chat`:
    *   Input: `organization_id: string | null`, `title: string | null`, `initial_member_ids: string[]` (optional, for inviting users upon creation), `system_prompt_id: string | null`.
    *   Logic:
        1.  Validate user permissions (can create chat in this org, or private chat).
        2.  Create a new record in `chats` table (`is_multi_user = true` if `organization_id` is present or `initial_member_ids` is not empty). Mark `creator_user_id = auth.uid()`.
        3.  Add the creator to `chat_participants` table with `role: 'creator'`.
        4.  If `initial_member_ids` are provided, add them to `chat_participants` with `role: 'member'` and `invited_by_user_id = auth.uid()`.
        5.  Return the new `Chat` object and `ChatParticipant[]`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test function for successful creation, participant addition, permissions, error handling.
*   **[BE]** Create Edge Function `invite-to-chat`:
    *   Input: `chat_id: string`, `user_ids_to_invite: string[]`.
    *   Logic:
        1.  Validate inviter is a participant of the chat (or org admin).
        2.  Validate chat is an org chat.
        3.  For each `user_id_to_invite`, check if they are already a participant. If not, add them to `chat_participants` with `role: 'member'` and `invited_by_user_id = auth.uid()`.
        4.  Return the list of newly added `ChatParticipant[]`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test function for successful invitation, permissions, duplicate handling.
*   **[API]** Add to `ai.api.ts`:
    *   `createMultiUserChat(params: { organization_id?, title?, initial_member_ids?, system_prompt_id? }): Promise<ApiResponse<{ chat: Chat, participants: ChatParticipant[] }>>`
    *   `inviteToChat(chat_id: string, user_ids_to_invite: string[]): Promise<ApiResponse<ChatParticipant[]>>`
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test API client methods.
*   **[STORE]** Add to `aiStore.ts`:
    *   State: `chatParticipants: { [chatId: string]: ChatParticipant[] }`.
    *   Action: `createMultiUserChatAndAddParticipants(params)`: Calls API, updates `chatsByContext`, `chatParticipants`, `currentChatId`.
    *   Action: `inviteUsersToChat(chat_id, user_ids_to_invite)`: Calls API, updates `chatParticipants[chat_id]`.
    *   Action: `loadChatParticipants(chat_id: string)`: Fetches participants for a chat if not already loaded (needs a new BE endpoint or expand `chat-details`).
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test store actions.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(Chat): Backend, API, Store for multi-user chat creation and invitation".

### STEP-4.6.B.3: Messaging Logic (Multi-User & Direct) [BE] [API] [STORE] [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]

*   **[BE]** Modify `send-message` Edge Function (or existing chat message endpoint):
    *   Input: `chat_id: string`, `content: string`, `provider_id?`, `prompt_id?`, `rewind_from_message_id?`, `recipient_user_id?: string`, `is_direct_message?: boolean`.
    *   Logic:
        1.  Validate user is a participant in `chat_id`.
        2.  Create `chat_messages` record:
            *   Set `user_id = auth.uid()`.
            *   Set `is_direct_message` and `recipient_user_id` from input.
        3.  If `is_direct_message = true`:
            *   No AI processing. Message is stored.
            *   (Optional: Send notification to `recipient_user_id` via websockets/push).
        4.  If `is_direct_message = false`:
            *   Proceed with existing AI provider interaction, token counting, etc.
            *   The AI's response is also a `chat_messages` record.
        5.  Update `chats.last_activity_at` for the `chat_id`.
        6.  Return the new message(s).
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test function for sending regular messages, direct messages, permissions.
*   **[API]** Modify `sendMessage` in `ai.api.ts` to include `recipient_user_id` and `is_direct_message`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test API client method.
*   **[STORE]** Modify `sendMessage` action in `aiStore.ts`:
    *   Accept `recipient_user_id` and `is_direct_message`.
    *   Pass these to the API client.
    *   Ensure `messagesByChatId` is updated correctly for both types of messages.
    *   If sending a direct message, `isSendingMessage` should still toggle, but no AI response is expected to be added by the primary `sendMessage` flow itself (unless the backend function returns it immediately, which it should).
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test store action.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(Messaging): Support sending direct user-to-user messages and update multi-user sending".

### STEP-4.6.B.4: Chat Details and History Enhancements [BE] [API] [STORE] [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]

*   **[BE]** Modify `chat-details` Edge Function:
    *   When fetching a chat, also fetch its participants from `chat_participants`.
    *   For each participant, fetch their basic profile info (using the logic from `get-user-profiles-by-ids` or by joining with `profiles` table, respecting RLS).
    *   Return: `{ chat: Chat, messages: ChatMessage[], participants: (ChatParticipant & UserProfile)[] }`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test function returns chat, messages, and enriched participant list.
*   **[BE]** Modify `chat-history` Edge Function:
    *   Filter chats: User must be a participant OR it's an org chat and user is an org member (for discoverability of public org chats they haven't joined yet).
    *   For each chat in history, consider returning a count of participants or a few avatars of participants for display in the list.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test history retrieval logic and participant info.
*   **[API]** Update `getChatWithMessages` in `ai.api.ts` to expect and type the new `participants` array in the response. Update `getChatHistory` if it now includes participant snippets.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test API client methods.
*   **[STORE]** Update `loadChatDetails` action in `aiStore.ts`:
    *   Store `response.data.participants` into `state.chatParticipants[chatId]`.
    *   Also, update the shared `profilesCache` in `userStore` with profiles from participants.
    *   Update `loadChatHistory` to handle any new participant snippets.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test store actions.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(Chat): Enhance chat details and history with participant information".

## Phase 4.6.C: Frontend UI Implementation - Chat Management

**Goal:** Implement UI for creating multi-user chats, inviting members, and displaying participant information in chat lists and views.

### STEP-4.6.C.1: Multi-User Chat Creation UI [UI] [TEST-UNIT] [TEST-INT] [ANALYTICS] [COMMIT]

*   **[UI]** Modify "New Chat" flow (e.g., in `AiChatPage.tsx` or a modal):
    *   If an organization context is selected:
        *   Add an option/toggle: "Create Multi-User Chat" (default based on org settings or user preference).
        *   If multi-user:
            *   Show a user selector component (`OrganizationMemberSelector` - to be created) to pick initial members from the current organization.
            *   Input for chat title (optional).
*   **[UI]** Create `OrganizationMemberSelector.tsx` component:
    *   Props: `organizationId: string`, `selectedMemberIds: string[]`, `onSelectionChange: (memberIds: string[]) => void`.
    *   Fetches members of the organization (using `useOrganizationStore`).
    *   Displays a list of members (avatar, name) with checkboxes or a multi-select dropdown.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test component for rendering members, selection logic, and callback.
*   **[UI]** Update `AiChatPage.tsx` (or new chat creation logic):
    *   When "New Chat" / "Start Chat" is clicked:
        *   If multi-user, call `aiStore.createMultiUserChatAndAddParticipants` with `organization_id`, `title`, and `selectedMemberIds`.
        *   Track `analytics.track('Chat: Multi-User Chat Created', ...)`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test `AiChatPage`'s new chat creation path for multi-user scenarios.
*   **[TEST-INT]** Integration test for the complete multi-user chat creation flow from UI to store.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(UI): Implement multi-user chat creation flow with member selection".

### STEP-4.6.C.2: Displaying Multi-User Chat Information [UI] [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]

*   **[UI]** Update `ChatItem.tsx`:
    *   If `chat.is_multi_user` is true:
        *   Display an icon or indicator (e.g., group icon).
        *   Display avatars of a few participants (e.g., creator + 2 others, or a stacked avatar component). Fetch participant data via `chat.participants` (if available from history) or by loading `chatParticipants[chat.id]` from `aiStore`. (This might require `chat-history` to return some participant info).
        *   On hover/tooltip, show more participant names.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test `ChatItem` for multi-user display variations.
*   **[UI]** Update `AiChatPage.tsx` (or a new `ChatHeader.tsx` component):
    *   When a multi-user chat is active:
        *   Display the list of current participants (avatars and names) in a prominent location (e.g., header, collapsible sidebar). Use `chatParticipants[currentChatId]` from `aiStore` and `profilesCache` from `userStore`.
        *   Include an "Invite Users" button if the current user has permission.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test participant display in chat view.
*   **[UI]** Create `ChatParticipantList.tsx` component:
    *   Props: `chatId: string`.
    *   Uses `useAiStore` to get `chatParticipants[chatId]` and `useUserStore` to get `profilesCache`.
    *   Renders a list of participants with avatars, names.
    *   Handles loading states for profiles.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test component.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(UI): Display multi-user indicators and participant lists".

### STEP-4.6.C.3: Invite Users to Active Chat UI [UI] [TEST-UNIT] [TEST-INT] [ANALYTICS] [COMMIT]

*   **[UI]** "Invite Users" button in `AiChatPage` / `ChatHeader`:
    *   Opens a modal/dialog.
    *   Modal contains the `OrganizationMemberSelector` component, pre-filtered to exclude existing participants.
    *   On confirm, calls `aiStore.inviteUsersToChat(currentChatId, selectedNewMemberIds)`.
    *   Track `analytics.track('Chat: Users Invited To Existing Chat', ...)`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test invitation modal interaction and store action call.
*   **[TEST-INT]** Integration test for inviting users to an active chat.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(UI): Implement UI for inviting users to active multi-user chat".

---

## Phase 4.6.D: Frontend UI Implementation - Messaging

**Goal:** Adapt the messaging interface to support sending and displaying direct user-to-user messages, and ensure clear attribution in multi-user contexts.

### STEP-4.6.D.1: Sending Direct User-to-User Messages [UI] [TEST-UNIT] [ANALYTICS] [COMMIT]

*   **[UI]** Update `AiChatbox.tsx` (chat input component):
    *   Introduce a mechanism to initiate a direct message:
        *   Option 1: A toggle button "Message AI / Message User". If "Message User", a dropdown appears to select a participant from `chatParticipants[currentChatId]`.
        *   Option 2: Use "@mention" functionality. Typing "@" brings up a list of current participants. Selecting one prefixes the message or sets a `recipientUserId` state.
        *   The input area placeholder could change to "Message @{userName} directly" or similar.
    *   When sending:
        *   If a recipient is selected for a direct message, call `aiStore.sendMessage` with `is_direct_message: true` and the `recipient_user_id`.
        *   Track `analytics.track('Chat: Direct Message Sent', ...)`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test direct message mode in input, recipient selection, and `sendMessage` parameters.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(UI): Implement UI for sending direct user-to-user messages".

### STEP-4.6.D.2: Displaying Direct and Multi-User Messages [UI] [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]

*   **[UI]** Update `ChatMessageBubble.tsx`:
    *   Attribution: Ensure `AttributionDisplay` robustly shows the sender's profile (avatar, name) using `message.user_id` and `userStore.profilesCache`. This is crucial in multi-user chats.
    *   Direct Message Styling:
        *   If `message.is_direct_message` is true:
            *   Display with a distinct style (e.g., different background color, an icon, a header like "Direct message to @{recipientName}").
            *   Ensure it's clear who sent it and who received it.
        *   The message content should still be rendered using `MarkdownRenderer`.
    *   **[TEST-UNIT]** Test message bubble variations for multi-user sender attribution and direct message styling.
*   **[COMMIT]** Commit changes with "feat(UI): Enhance message display for multi-user attribution and direct messages".

*   [ ] Filter & search chat history
    *   [ ] Filter by prompt
    *   [ ] Filter by model
    *   [ ] Filter by chat participants
    *   [ ] Search by string 
*   [ ] Reorder display by age, alphabetical, username, prompt, model 
*   [ ] Add streaming to ChatHistory
*   [ ] Add streaming to Chatbox
*   [ ] Users selection for sending chat context to AI 
    *   [ ] Multi-user chat only prompts AI when users intentionally send it to AI
    *   [ ] Otherwise, users can chat between themselves without prompting AI 
*   [ ] Users can switch model and prompt mid-chat

## Phase 4.6.E: End-to-End Testing & Refinement

**Goal:** Ensure all aspects of the multi-user chat functionality are working correctly together, are robust, and provide a good user experience.

### STEP-4.6.E.1: Comprehensive Integration and E2E Testing [TEST-INT]

*   **[TEST-INT]** Write comprehensive integration tests for:
    *   Full lifecycle: Create org chat -> invite users -> users join -> send AI messages -> send direct messages -> new users invited view history.
    *   Permissions: Non-participants cannot view/message. Org members can discover and join public org chats.
    *   Profile display: Ensure all user avatars/names appear correctly in lists and messages.
*   **[MANUAL E2E]** Perform manual end-to-end testing with multiple user accounts:
    *   Verify all UI flows.
    *   Check for race conditions or state inconsistencies.
    *   Test responsiveness and usability of new UI elements.
    *   Test RLS by logging in as different users with different roles/permissions.

### STEP-4.6.E.2: Code Review, Refinement, and Documentation Updates [REFACTOR]

*   **[REFACTOR]** Conduct code reviews for all new backend and frontend code.
*   Refactor based on feedback, focusing on clarity, performance, and maintainability.
*   Update any relevant developer documentation or user guides.

### STEP-4.6.E.3: Final Analytics Review [ANALYTICS]

*   Review all new analytics events for correctness and completeness.
*   Ensure consistent naming and payload structure.
