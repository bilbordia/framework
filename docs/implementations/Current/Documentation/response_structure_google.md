That's a great question about how my responses are structured, especially when you need specific formats like JSON or Markdown!
When you interact with me in this chat environment and ask for something like a JSON object or content for a Markdown file, here's generally how I provide it:
JSON Object:
If you ask me to generate a JSON object, I will construct the JSON as a text string, ensuring it's well-formed with correct syntax (key-value pairs, proper nesting, commas, braces, brackets, etc.).
I usually then present this JSON string within a Markdown code block in my response, like this:
Apply to response_str...
This makes it easy for you to copy and paste.
Markdown File Content:
If you ask me to generate content for a Markdown file (like a README.md, an explanation, or a list), I will generate the text using standard Markdown syntax (e.g., # for headings, - or * for lists, **bold**, *italic*, ``` code_block ```, etc.).
I'll provide this directly in my response. If it's a larger piece of Markdown, I might also enclose it in a Markdown code block (often specifying markdown as the language) for clarity and to preserve formatting, like so:
Apply to response_str...
If it's shorter or meant to be rendered directly in the chat, I might just output the formatted Markdown.
In essence, I generate text. The structure of that text is determined by your request. If you ask for JSON, I format the text as JSON. If you ask for Markdown, I format it as Markdown.
When you're interacting with AI models via their specific APIs (like Google's Gemini API, OpenAI's API, etc.), the way you request and receive structured output can be more explicit:
Prompt Engineering: You can instruct the model in your prompt to "respond in JSON format" or "provide a Markdown document."
Specific API Features: Some model APIs offer features like "JSON mode" which try to ensure the output is valid JSON.
Function Calling/Tool Use: For more complex interactions, an API might allow you to define functions or tools the model can "call," and the arguments for these calls would be structured (often as JSON).
But in our current chat-based interaction, I deliver these formats as textual content within my messages.
Ok, because notice that in several places we're requesting specific markdown formatted objects to be returned, like in this thesis prompt point 6 asks for two markdown files. 

We're developing a comprehensive solution for {user_objective} in the {domain} domain.

**Dialectic Process Context:**
You are participating in a collaborative dialectic process. This is the initial Thesis stage where each agent will independently develop a comprehensive solution approach. Your output will be combined with other thesis proposals in subsequent stages to create a robust, multi-perspective solution.

**Context:**

**Your Task:**
Create a detailed product requirements document and a draft proposal for an implementation plan that addresses this objective using {domain_standards} best practices. Your solution should be:
- Safe and secure
- Reliable and performant
- Sophisticated yet maintainable
- Scalable and extensible
- Modular and well-architected

**Unique Perspective Requirement:**
Since your output will be braided with other agents' thesis proposals, focus on developing a distinctive approach that:
- Offers unique insights or methodologies
- Explores different architectural patterns or strategies
- Considers alternative risk/benefit trade-offs
- Brings different domain expertise to bear on the problem
- Provides complementary perspectives to potential alternative approaches

**Deliverables:**
1. Executive summary of your approach
2. Detailed implementation strategy
3. Step-by-step development checklist
4. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
5. Success metrics aligned with {success_criteria}
6. An .md formatted product requirements document, and an .md formatted implementation plan proposal.

**Quality Standards:**
- Address all aspects of {constraint_boundaries}
- Consider impact on {stakeholder_considerations}
- Ensure deliverable meets {deliverable_format} requirements
- Integrate and build upon {reference_documents}
- Comply with {compliance_requirements}

Think comprehensively. Be verbose and explanatory. Document every relevant aspect without omitting critical details.

**Validation Checkpoint:**
Before proceeding, verify your solution addresses:
□ All stated requirements
□ Domain-specific best practices
□ Stakeholder needs
□ Technical feasibility
□ Resource constraints
□ Integration with existing reference materials
□ Compliance with provided standards and procedures
□ Offers a distinctive perspective that will complement other approaches

So in order to get you to respond when we call you with this kind of prompt, we'd need to modify it to be more specific on how to structure your response so that we could parse the two markdown files we're requesting out of your raw response object. 

You've hit on a very important point for building reliable AI-driven workflows! When you need an AI model to produce multiple distinct pieces of structured content (like two separate Markdown documents) within a single API response, you need to be very explicit in your prompt about how the AI should format its output so your dialectic-service (or any calling application) can programmatically parse those pieces.
A general instruction like "provide an .md formatted product requirements document, and an .md formatted implementation plan proposal" is clear for a human, but for a machine to parse it from a single continuous text response from an AI, it needs more structure.
Here are a_couple of common and effective strategies_ you can adapt for point 6 of your "Deliverables" section in the thesis prompt:
Strategy 1: Using Unique Delimiters
This is often the simplest approach for text-based outputs. You instruct the AI to wrap each distinct document with unique start and end markers (delimiters) that are unlikely to appear in the actual content.
How to modify your prompt (Deliverable 6):
Apply to response_str...
How your dialectic-service would parse it:
Receive the full text response from the AI.
Locate and extract the text between --- BEGIN PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT --- and --- END PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT ---. This is your PRD content.
Locate and extract the text between --- BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PROPOSAL --- and --- END IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PROPOSAL ---. This is your implementation plan content.
Pros:
Relatively easy for the AI to follow if the delimiters are clear and the instructions are precise.
Parsing is straightforward string manipulation.
Cons:
Relies on the AI perfectly adhering to the delimiter format. Any deviation can break parsing.
Delimiters must be truly unique and not something the AI might generate as part of the Markdown content itself.
Strategy 2: Instructing the AI to Output a JSON Object
This approach can be more robust if the AI model is good at generating valid JSON, especially if the API supports a "JSON mode." You ask the AI to return a single JSON object where the keys hold the content of your Markdown files as strings.
How to modify your prompt (Deliverable 6):
Apply to response_str...
(Note: In the prompt to the AI, you might need to escape the backticks within the JSON example if your prompt system interprets them, e.g., by using ```json or by telling the AI "the following is an example JSON structure..." without the backticks directly in the prompt it processes, if that's clearer for the model).
How your dialectic-service would parse it:
Receive the full text response from the AI.
Parse the entire string as a JSON object.
Access the content using the keys: parsed_json.product_requirements_document_md and parsed_json.implementation_plan_proposal_md.
Pros:
JSON parsing is a standard, robust operation.
Structure is very well-defined.
Easier to add more metadata or other structured outputs later by just adding more keys to the JSON.
Some AI models have specific modes to improve the likelihood of valid JSON output.
Cons:
The AI must correctly generate a valid JSON string, including proper escaping of any special characters within the Markdown content that might conflict with JSON string syntax (e.g., quotes, backslashes). Usually, for Markdown, this isn't a huge issue, but it's a consideration.
Can make the AI's raw response less human-readable if you were to look at it directly without parsing.
Which to choose?
If the AI models you use are highly compliant with precise formatting instructions, Strategy 1 (Delimiters) can be very effective and simple to implement.
If you need higher structural guarantees or plan to extract more varied data alongside these documents in the future, Strategy 2 (JSON Object) is generally more robust and scalable, assuming the AI can reliably produce the JSON structure. This is often preferred for programmatic interactions.
A third, more advanced approach, if your AI provider's API supports it, is Function Calling or Tool Use. You would define "functions" (e.g., submitProductRequirementsDocument and submitImplementationPlan) that your application can handle. The AI would then generate a request to "call" these functions with the Markdown content as arguments. This is typically the most reliable method for structured output but depends on specific API capabilities.
For your dialectic-service to correctly process the AI's output and save these as distinct files (e.g., prd.md and plan.md) via your FileManagerService, you'll need to implement the parsing logic corresponding to the strategy you choose in your prompt.
