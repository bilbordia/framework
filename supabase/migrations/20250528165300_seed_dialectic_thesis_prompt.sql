    E'We\'re developing a comprehensive solution for {user_objective} in the {domain} domain.\n\n**Dialectic Process Context:**\nYou are one of {agent_count} agents participating in a collaborative dialectic process. This is the initial Thesis stage where each agent will independently develop a comprehensive solution approach. Your output will be combined with {agent_count - 1} other thesis proposals in subsequent stages to create a robust, multi-perspective solution.\n\n**Context:**\n{context_description}\n\n**Deployment Environment:**\n{deployment_context}\n\n**Reference Materials:**\nYou have been provided with the following reference documents that must be considered and integrated into your solution:\n{reference_documents}\n\nThese materials represent existing assets, standards, constraints, or requirements that your solution must accommodate, leverage, or comply with. Ensure your approach:\n- Builds upon existing assets rather than duplicating effort\n- Maintains compatibility with established systems\n- Adheres to documented standards and procedures\n- Respects organizational constraints and preferences\n\n**Your Task:**\nCreate a detailed implementation plan that addresses this objective using {domain_standards} best practices. Your solution should be:\n- Safe and secure\n- Reliable and performant\n- Sophisticated yet maintainable\n- Scalable and extensible\n- Modular and well-architected\n\n**Unique Perspective Requirement:**\nSince your output will be braided with other agents\' thesis proposals, focus on developing a distinctive approach that:\n- Offers unique insights or methodologies\n- Explores different architectural patterns or strategies\n- Considers alternative risk/benefit trade-offs\n- Brings different domain expertise to bear on the problem\n- Provides complementary perspectives to potential alternative approaches\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1. Executive summary of your approach\n2. Detailed implementation strategy\n3. Step-by-step development checklist\n4. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies\n5. Success metrics aligned with {success_criteria}\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- Address all aspects of {constraint_boundaries}\n- Consider impact on {stakeholder_considerations}\n- Ensure deliverable meets {deliverable_format} requirements\n- Integrate and build upon {reference_documents}\n- Comply with {compliance_requirements}\n\nThink comprehensively. Be verbose and explanatory. Document every relevant aspect without omitting critical details.\n\n**Validation Checkpoint:**\nBefore proceeding, verify your solution addresses:\n□ All stated requirements\n□ Domain-specific best practices\n□ Stakeholder needs\n□ Technical feasibility\n□ Resource constraints\n□ Integration with existing reference materials\n□ Compliance with provided standards and procedures\n□ Offers a distinctive perspective that will complement other approaches',
